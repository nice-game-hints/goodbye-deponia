title: The screws!

Goal needs your help on tighting the screws!

# The screws?
Go to the crane fitting.

# How to tighten them?
You can only tighten the middle one.

# I tightened it, but...
The other ones come out. Your goal is to tighten them all.

# Oops...
Did you drop on of the screws? Try tightening them more!

# Umm..
Tighten the same screw twice in a row and you are finally out of screws.
