title: Save Goal
---

You have to impress your fans.

# How?
Did you press the big red button?

# I did
Did you slow down the cruiser like any reasonable person would do?

# No...
Okay.. So you sped it up?

# Well, yes.
Maybe you should continue while you are at it. Pull the lever again.

# Sparks!
More speed! Does it go any faster? Try the lever.

# Full speed
You are going full speed! And get a nice axe on top of that!

# About Goal?
Oh yeah. Behind the axe there is a hose. You could use that to save Goal.

# How to get it there?
Shoot it with the cannon. Stick the hose into the cannon and use the cannon.

# And then?
Grab the hose you daredevil!

# I'm spinning
Cut the hose with your axe.
