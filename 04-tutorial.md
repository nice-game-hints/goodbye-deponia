You are in an endless tutorial. Putting the yin and pressing the button just brings you back.

# Endless
Have you tried walking around?

# Hmm..
On the right side there is a red floor panel. Walk on that.

# It disappears
Use the yin to jam it in place. You can now see more.

# Power inverter
Yes, the presser would work little differently. Put the power inverter into the indentation.

# Whoa
Push the button to open the hole in the floor and jump down there.

# Conveyor belt
That is some Sierra level stuff. Yeah, we get the reference.

# What to do?
There is the control console. Messing with the fuses messes with the things messing with you.

# Help
The goal is to get you in full form through the belt. It is a skippable minigame.
