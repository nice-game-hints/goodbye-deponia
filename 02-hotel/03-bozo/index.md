Bozo is not giving up. He is warm and he likes to do that basic instinct thing ... ugh.

# How to get his clothes
The clothes are in the laundry room. Just go and get them.

# He is not wearing them
Yeah, because he is warm. You need to get him to believe he has whooping pox. The symptoms of whooping pox are: fever, coughing, sniffles and a blue tongue.

# How?
Maybe if he would eat something that would cause the symptoms.

# Like?
Like a [pie](/02-hotel/04-pie.md)!

# Simple pie?
No, you should fix the pie first. Tune it so that it causes

 - [cough](034-cough.md)
 - [sneeze](033-sneeze.md)
 - [blue tongue](035-blue.md)
 
# Pie is ready
And is he feeling [cold](031-heater.md), also?

# Yes, he is
He is now ready for his clothes. You should have them from the laundry. He gives you his towel.
