Doc is preventing you from getting the screwdriver.

# I know!
If you would enter the room as Cletus, maybe they would be afraid of you.

# As Cletus?
Yeah, you have done it before, haven't you. Just wear his clothes.

# His clothes
They are in the washing machine at the laundry room.

# But the mysterious laundry sect
Yeah. [Do their ritual](11-laundry-sect.md), first.

# Humm Homm Kumbayeaa
I take that as you got Cletus' clothes? Nice.

# Umm, yeah, that's right
Wear his clothes (right click on them in the inventory) and get into room five and get the screwdriver.
