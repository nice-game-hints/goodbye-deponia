As you visited the reception and saw Cletus Oppenbot said something about the plasma exchange whoopie relay.

# He did
But you can't approach him as Rufus. Disquise yourself as Cletus. Get his clothes form the laundry room. You just have to get pass [the laundry sect](11-laundry-sect.md).

# I got them
Wear them by right-clicking on them in the inventory. You can now speak with Oppenbot and the Receptionist.

# It is in my room
You mean Cletus' room. So, [you should just get Cletus out of your.. no, his room.](14-room.md)

# I am in the room
The bag with the mammuth exchange whoopiecushion fur is there. Don't mix them up.

# I won't
You did, did you? Cletus is coming. Hide next to the pipe (click it).

# How do I get out?
Did you read the ingredient warnings?

# Of what?
Of the carpet cleaner.

# Umm.. something something
Toothpaste. Combine it with toothpaste.

# Chloroform...
Chloroform paste. Cletus has similar tube on his mirror stand. Look at the mirror, and screw the nut away with your screwdriver. Swap the pastes. Don't mix them!

# How to get him to brush?
Throw a mothball into the pipe. He will eat one and start brushing.

# But, switch-swap
You mixed them! Always the same thing.

# What now?
Open the mirror. Maybe you could fool him. It opens a skippable minigame where you should follow his toothbrush movement.

# Oppenbot!
Give him the money bag. Not the mammuth exchange relaycushion bag. Don't mix them!

# I tried...
Of course. Go to the reception and talk with them. You get the plasma mammuth exchange thingy bag easily enough.
