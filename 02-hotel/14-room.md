Cletus is in the room number 1. Maybe you could get yourself into there.

# Okay, how?
Have you played with the intercom already? There is one in your room.

# Of course
Call to the reception and order some food. [You have the menu, right?](09-menu.md)

# I ordered lunch
It must be something tasty, I guess. So, it is 12 o'clock.

# Time is not going anywhere
Well, it is a point and click adventure. The time does not advance on its own. Maybe you could fool the receptionist a little.

# The clock on the wall
There is something else on the wall *at the restaurant*. Other side of the clock.

# Painting?
Yup. Remove the painting and tune the clock. You have to screw the nut with the [screwdriver](10-screwdriver.md). Twice.

# Cletus eating
Now it is your time to take his role. Talk to the receptionist dressed as Cletus. You get *a* key.

# Key to Cletus' room?
Go try it.

# It is the wrong key!
It is. Give it back to the receptionist.

# Uh, oh
Now, don't let Cletus get his own key.

# How do I do that?
I think the clock on the wall acts as a key holder.

# And?
Screw the nut, again. Twice. Cletus gets a wrong key.

# Let me guess
Go talk to the receptionist, again. Give him your other key, number 5.

# He is weird
You should screw the nut again. Twice. Then he gives you the correct key. Key number 1. Use that to get into his room.
