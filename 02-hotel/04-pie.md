There is a pie vending machine behind the rooms. Did you try to catch one pie?

# Ouch, no change
Yeah, you would need some money.

# Paper money, that is
Yes, there is a rich man checking in to the hotel given that you have [visited your friends](/02-hotel/01-friends.md).

# Oppenbot
He is guarding the bag. Steal the bag.

# How?
Did you notice that Bozo has similar bag? Go grab Bozo's bag.

# And then?
Go to the restaurant (behind the reception) and switch Oppenbot's bag with Bozo's bag. Look at the bag and you get some paper money.

# But it is not coins
Who would need **paper** money more than you, now?

# Who?
The toilet paper quality of this hotel is known to be worst.

# So?
Give the paper money to the future traveller in the toilet. He will give a coin as a change. Now you have coin.

# It is too big
Maybe you could grind it smaller.

# With what?
Did I mention about the quality of the toilet paper in this hotel?

# You did, yes
Well, get some of that sand .. err.. toilet paper and make the coin smaller by combining the toilet paper with the coin.

# It got smaller
Go use it to the vending machine now. One pie, pour favor.
