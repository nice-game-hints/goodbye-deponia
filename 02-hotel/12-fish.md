What is it with fish and this game series? Seriously?

# Okay okay, enough, where's the fish?
There is a pelican in the trash bin.

# An angry pelican! Yikes!
Drive it away with something bad tasting.

# With what?
Use the salt shaker (you get it from the restaurant behind the reception) in the trash bin.

# It flew away
Now it has its beak open and that juicy fish is jumping there. Go grab it.

# It bites!
Maybe you should use some tool to keep its beak open for a while.

# Beak opener?
Get Bozo's clothes from the laundry and take the coathanger. Use the coathanger on the pelican. You have a fish now!
