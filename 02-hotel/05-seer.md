Talk with the Seer. The laundry sect is waiting the Seer to come and speak to them.

# He is not ready
Yeah, he is preparing for his grand speech. That takes too long. Maybe you should take his place.

# How?
Easy, steal his bathrobe.

# But, how?
Well, when does a seer remove his bathrobe?

# Is this a joke?
No, when he goes to shower, of course.

# Okay, how do I do that?
Notice how he tries out the hood when you say he looks alright?

# He does!
Maybe you could add something fishy into his hood.

# Fishy?
[Go get a fish!](12-fish.md)

# And then
Use the fish knife (found on the floor in the Ghost's room) on the fish and you get some shiny scales. Put the scales into seer's hood and say that he looks good. He tries out the hood.

# Dandruff!
Ingenious! He can't go to the speech like that! He needs to wash first.

# Washing?
Yeah, wash it with shampoo. You get some shampoo from Bozo's bag. He has the bag in the room five. Look into the bag to get the shampoo.

# He threw me out!
Yes, he needed to get a shower. There was someone who liked to watch people shower.

# The Ghost?
Yeah, the ghost is now looking into the hole. He will be there for a while. Go check the reception and tell others about Cletus. Or [get the towel from Bozo](03-bozo/). At some point the Ghost is gone.

# Got it!
The seer should now be with his wet hair. Wait a minute? Hair?!

# It's the shampoo
Okay. Well, the seer is not ready to have his speech yet. He still tries the hood on if you say he is ready.

# Well, what next?
Maybe give him some more *hair trouble*. Like lices!

# Lice?
This hotel and its cleaning standards! The pillows are dirty and full of lice.

# Pillows
And pillowcases. Get a pillowcase from the closet (next to the rooms) and put the lice into his hood. Say that he looks ok.

# Showering, again
But this time he didn't lock the door (for some reason). Go grab the bathrobe.
