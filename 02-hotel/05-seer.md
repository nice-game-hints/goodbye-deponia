You need to pimp up the seer's hood to make him ready for the speech.

# Pimp?
Yep, something glittering. Nothing fishy.

# Fishy?
Or fishy, if you like. Go get a fish!

# Fish, again. Okay, where?
There is a pelican in the trash bin.

# An angry pelican! Yikes!
Drive it away with something bad tasting.

# With what?
Use the salt shaker (you get it from the restaurant behind the reception) in the trash bin.

# It flew away
Now it has its beak open and that juicy fish is jumping there. Go grab it.

# It bites!
Maybe you should use some tool to keep its beak open for a while.

# Beak opener?
Get Bozo's clothes from the laundry and take the coathanger. Use the coathanger on the pelican. You have a fish now!

# And then
Use the fish knife (found in the restaurant) on the fish and you get some shiny scales. Put the scales into seer's hood and say that he looks good to him.

# Dandruff!
Err.. okay. It didn't go exactly like planned. How to get rid of it?

# Washing?
Yeah, wash it with shampoo. You get some shampoo from Bozo's bag. He has the bag in the room five. Look into the bag to get the shampoo.

# He threw me out!
Yes, he needed to get a shower. There was someone who liked to watch people shower.
