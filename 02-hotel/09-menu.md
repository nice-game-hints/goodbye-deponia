You should get the menu from the reception.

# But Oppenbot
The Oppenbot just stands there. Stupid thing.

# How to get rid of it?
Maybe you could contact him remotely.

# Remotely
Like, using the intercom

# Where?
In the same room with your friends. Room number five.

# Calling
Cletus is in the room one. Call from room number one and speak to your assistant.

# Done
Now, leave the corridor by entering the pie vending machine room first. Then you get to the reception without facing Oppenbot. Speak to the receptionist dressed as Rufus.
