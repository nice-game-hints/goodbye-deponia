The clothes of Cletus are in the washing machine. The laundry sect is waiting the Seer (in one of the hotel rooms) to come and speak to them.

# He is not ready
He is not, and will not be. [Get his robe](05-seer.md)

# I have it
Now, enter the temple.. I mean the laundry room. They will require the sacred relics.

# Relics?
Try to find some items with insignia on them.

# What are they?
 - The pillowcase, from the closet
 - [Bozo's towel](03-bozo/index.md)
 - The ghost's sheet. You get it from the room where the ghost was.

Deliver each relic to the sect

# Delivered
Next is a skippable minigame to get the clothes of Cletus.
