The factory door opens only when you have done your job.

# Okay
Factory workers use time clock to tell they are done.

# It is alone
You should first talk to the mystery guy. After that there is the time card. You have to [get out](010-get-out.md).

# I am out and talked
Get the time card next to the time clock and punch it in the clock.

# The holes are closed up
You need to make holes into it.

# Where?
There is the vampire platypus with sharp theeth. Go show the card to it and it will open the holes.

# Overtime record
Nice, and you got yourself some garlic.
