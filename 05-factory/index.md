What is this place? All these cauges and factory thingies.

# Where to?
Try to [get out of the residence](010-get-out.md) first.

# I discussed with him
So, this is a complicated thing. You have yourself a cloning machine.

# Okay
Did you try to create a clone of Hermes? He will jump to his death.

# There's the third shredder
It is broken and has a mattress. You would need to create **three** copies (controlled with the switch) of Hermes to save one! You only have ingredients for one. You can see it from the cauges at the factory floor.

# More stuff
You can find enough stuff for two Hermeses from the residence. Oil bottle, sack of beans and water cooler. Throw them into the funnel.

# I need more!
There is the food truck behind the factory door. [Open the door](020-door.md) and [break into the food truck](030-truck.md).

# I'm in
Grab all the stuff.

# Something is missing
The last ingredient is the platypus egg.

# Not again!
You can find the egg from the pipe valve. [Get it](040-egg.md) and throw that also into the funnel.

# Done, full cauges
Now you can create three Hermeses. Turn the switch to three and push the button to get Hermes. Then, pull the lever. One of them survives.
