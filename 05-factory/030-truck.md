The food truck door is rusted shut.

# Obstacle
Yeah, one more. How to get rid of rust?

# With...
...oil, yes. You find some oil ingredients from the residence.

# Oil bottle
No, it is too old. You have to make fresh oil.

# From?
Olives, of course. Insert them into the oil mill and take the vial. Apply the olive oil into the food truck door.
