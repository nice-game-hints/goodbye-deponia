There is always need for an extra screwdriver

# There is
You can order it, you know?

# How
With the mail chute and application forms.

# Tell me more
Really? Okay, go to the outer balcony (with the sleeping guard).

# I'm there
Open the crate and take an application form. Read it.

# Took it and read it
Still don't get it?

# No I don't
Fine. Put the application form in to the terminal, next to the crate.

# It is there
Select option B (screwdriver!)

# Selected
Okay... I... just... put the application form into the mail cartridge.

# There it is
And... put the mail cartridge into the mail chute.

# I put it in there
You already got the screwdriver. Click "I got it!"

# No!
You are misusing this tool! There are no more hints about getting the screwdriver!

# Yes there are!
What? I don't have anything. Stop this! There are two screwdrivers, one from Janosch and one from the mail order. You lost the first one. That is enough.

# You are angry!
Well, why do you have to click that button? I'm out...
