You are Organon's prisoner. Stupid Cowboy Dodo. Talk to the Cell Guard.

# Hints?
Talk to the Organon to get:
 - Breakfast
 - Toilet supplies
 - Clean cell

Check out the blanket.

# It is already clean
Yeah. It would be a shame if something would happen to it.

# Hehee...
How about some coffee on the rug? Pour coffee there!

# Hey!
Tidybot! Old friend. And it has some dust in its bag. Get the dust.

# Okay
Now you have in your inventory: bagel, dust, toothpaste, urinal cake and pepper. Have I seen this before?

# You have
Let's make a delicious bagel again. Combine all of those with the bagel.

# Ready
Now, Clet... I mean your clone can eat it. Give it to him. The guard hasn't seen but one of you.

# He ate it!
Now, tell the guard about the sick prisoner.
