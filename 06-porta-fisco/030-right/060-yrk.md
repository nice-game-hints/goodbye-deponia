**Right Rufus**

The terminal is missing the Yrk.  Hmm.. and the replacement Yrk needs... Yrk! Who designs these things? If there was just an extra Yrk somewhere...

# Actually
Oh yeah. At the editor's office at Porta Fisco. Use **Middle Rufus**. You don't believe it, but [getting Toni back is essential for this](../020-middle/090-toni.md).

# Yrk!
Yeah, if you did everything right, the paperplane with Yrk should be up here now. Get it from the wall and attach it to the terminal. You can now order more Yrks!
