**Right Rufus**

The highboat needs the ascension codes for entry. Go into the upper door.

# I'm in
Go use the dictaphone.

# Yikes, Argus!
Oh, you are in trouble. Get hiding. You have the dictaphone and Argus has lost the combination. You can look at the dictaphone.

# What to do?
Take the cartridge away (eject) and put the dictaphone back to the desk.

# He tries to hear something from
Maybe you could fake it. Talk to Argus. Say the combination 4437.

# Oh the noise!
Nice, noise! You can turn the alarm off from the button.

# I did it!
No! Not yet. Say the combination again and then open the window as the alarm is so loud they don't hear you.

# It's open
Now you can record a new message into the dictaphone. Insert the cartridge back into the dictaphone. Look at it and play it first. Do it outside so you can do it without them hearing you.

# I got it
Good, it was 44... something.. you got it.

# And then?
Record something else for Argus.

# What?
Say that the cartridge fell behind the desk. Heehee...

# Recorded
Get back in and put the dictaphone (with the cartridge in) on the desk. Shut down the alarm.

# Sneaky
You can now enter the office through the door. Open the safe (twice).
