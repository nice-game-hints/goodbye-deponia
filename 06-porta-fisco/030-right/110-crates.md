**Right Rufus**

You are at the crate lug with Oppenbot. Could you hide in a barrel?

# I could
It is just missing the label with the destination. Do you remember what it looked like from the beginning?

# No?
It looked a lot like those papers you've been painting with *Middle Rufus*.

# Oh yeah!
[Can you switch items with *Left Rufus*?](120-left-rufus.md)

# I can
Great, now you can transfer the picture of Elysium from *Middle Rufus* to *Right Rufus* through *Left Rufus*.

# I did it
Confusing. Anyways, **Right Rufus** should now have the picture. Go attach it to the barrel and hop in.

# Nothing happens
Talk to Oppenbot from the barrel.
