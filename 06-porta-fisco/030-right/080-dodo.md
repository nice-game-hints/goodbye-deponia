**Right Rufus**

Wouldn't you like to get rid of that annoying Cowboy Dodo. You can't do it until you
[have bought your Cletus-clone with you](040-missing.md) for the votes.

# Okay, voted
The votes are still even. How could you get rid of Cowboy Dodo?

# Shoot him?
Ouch! I like that. With what, though?

# Something big
Like a mail cartridge?

# Yes!
Cool, shoot him with that! You can probably use the tube there.

# It is screwed tight
Unscrew it with [a screwdriver](090-screwdriver.md).

# It's open ... and closed
Maybe you could get help from someone?

# Like?
Like your clone. Give the screwdriver to Cletus.

# He is helping!
How nice of him. Now shoot him!

# How?
Put the mail cartridge into the mail chute at the balcony. Get back there.

# Urrhh...
Hmm.. well, that almost worked. Now you only need the rope.
