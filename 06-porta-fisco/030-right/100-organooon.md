**Right Rufus**

So, you disquised yourself once more and now you are listening that beautiful organon anthem.

# How do I get away?
What can you do? If you move anywhere he will stop you.

# I can..
You can use the cannon

# It doesn't do anything
Maybe if there would be actual rebels spotted? Get *Middle Rufus* [through the rebel hideout door.](../020-middle/050-bozo.md)

# He is there
Shoot with the cannon. You can now walk into the crate lug without them noticing.
