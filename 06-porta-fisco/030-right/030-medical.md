**Right Rufus**

The door sensor only lets in Organons. Luckily, you are the master of disquise.

# What next?
Did you talk to the guys at the crawl space already? [Did you get a mail capsule?](050-mail-capsule.md)

# Yes
That stupid Cowboy Dodo is blocking your way. Maybe you could use him to your advantage. Try to lure an Organon against him.

# How?
Did you check the application forms in the crate? Medical assistance probably means more Organons.

# Okay
Use the terminal behind the cover to type into the application form. [Is it missing an Yrk?](060-yrk.md)

# No, all the Yrks are there
Nice, you can then type an application form for medical help: Yrk-75.

# Typed
Put the applicaton form into the mail cartridge and put it into the chute.

# Cowboy
Well, he is an idiot, and used our rope! Get the Organon's clothes.

# And then?
Switch to the Organon outfit and use the door sensor.
