**Right Rufus**
The Organons are marching into the ascension station. Rufus should get there also. Maybe those crates would help...

# Where to?
Go to the pipe on the right.

# And?
Did you try to go to the crates?

# Yeah, guards!
You should distract them. Push the button in the lamp post. It also lights the lamp in the sewers.

# Crates
Now you can approach the crates. Those that are going to Elysium are marked with corresponding pictures. That's it for now. Go try something else with other Rufuses.
