**Middle Rufus**

Bambina and Lotti (sorry, Sgt. Bambi and Pvt. Lotti) need help designing the squad insignia tattoo (you should discuss with them until they say about this). First, you need paper.

# Where?
From the editor's office (the middle door from the district center). Grab the ink, also.

# I have them
I think you are an artist! Draw something cool to the paper with the ink. Combine them. Maybe that is enough for them.

# No
Yeah, it is just a blob. Maybe some kind of a picture of a furry animal would be cool.

# Furry animal?
You know. Like in petting zoos.

# Petting zoo?
There is a petting zoo in the sewers. Give the blackened paper to *Left Rufus*. [You know how to exchange items, don't you?](../005-exchange.md)

# I gave it
**Left Rufus**

That nice man has a petting zoo in his van. You should show the kids a picture of the animal.

# What?
**Left Rufus**

Go to the van and use the blackened paper on the cute furry animal (?). Nice picture of a... a... well, something. Rusty won't believe you (thus, your picture returning to jsut a blob) until you can tell what the picture is. Any of your guesses is wrong.

That picture looks a lot like those Rorscarch tests.

# Rorscarch?
You know. Ones the therapists use. [Get to a therapist session](030-therapist.md) and take the Rorscarch test (beware the lions).

# I did
**Left Rufus**
Now, use the blackened paper again on the cute furry animal. Now you can say something meaningful to Rusty about the picture. The picture stays intact! It could be used as a cool squad insignia tattoo.

# That is true!
**Left Rufus**

Give it to *Middle Rufus*. As **Middle Rufus** then show it to Bambina. They love it!
