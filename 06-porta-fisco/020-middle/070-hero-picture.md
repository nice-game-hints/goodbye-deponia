Barry, from the editor's office, wants to take a picture of you doing a heroic deed.

# Okay, what deed?
Did you spot something disturbing when you visited the rebel camp?

# Like?
The blurry blob far away. Take your finger focus from the inventory (it should be there if you discussed with Barry) and focus on that blurry blob.

# It's!
It's a baby in danger! Go tell Barry.

# High
No problem for a hero. Just save the baby.

# Plan?
You would need to tie the other end of the support.

# Rope?
Yes, rope is good. [Get a rope.](080-rope.md)

# Rope
Put the rope into the hook and go talk with Baby Bozo.

# Trapped
Tilt the support to catch him!

# Help me!
Point to the rope end!
