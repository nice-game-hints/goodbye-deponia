**Middle Rufus**

Toni is in the tank and is now part of the rebellion. Something is not just right.

# Too calm
Yes, she is too calm. Can you wreck her nerves?

# No
Not even saying that there were multiple Rufuses?

# She doesn't believe it
Show her!

# How?
If you could show yourself and the other self through some kind of radio device.

# Radio device?
There is a baby phone at Casa Bozo. Go get it and try it out.

# No one answers
It can be tuned to certain frequencies.

# Really?
Use it on the radio next to Toni. You can now reach Toni anywhere, yay! Try it out with right click in the inventory.

# Nice, but
Maybe you should try it from the sewers. Give it to *Left Rufus*. Then, *Middle Rufus* sitting next to Toni contact her by *Left Rufus*. Clear?

# Clear
Toni went to see her therapist. Maybe you should, too. Maybe wreck her nerves one last time.

# How?
Like, throwing something at her. Like an paper airplane? Pick up the flyer from the rope seller and throw Toni with it.

# It flew down
Maybe it needs some weight on it's nose. Get the capital Yrk and attach it to the nose of the paperplane. Go throw it again.

# Updrafts!
Oh. It's up there now. [This is a job for the *Right Rufus*.](../030-right/060-yrk.md)

# Downdrafts
The therapist wrote a rope prescription for Toni.
