Liebold won't let you in. That idiot!

# Someone has to be with me
Maybe Bambina or Lotti could help? Talk to them (after visiting the gate).

# Talking
They need help designing the [squad insignia tattoo.](025-tattoo-design.md)

# Tattooed
Lotti won't help you. But Bambina is in the tank!

# Well, she is...
But she is not doing that either.

# So...
The only option is: [Bozo](050-bozo.md). Sigh...
