Bozo is not getting up. You should feed him some sweet mind drugs.

# Drugs?
There is medicine in the therapists locker.

# He doesn't let me
Maybe he would prescripe some uppers for you.

# How?
Play the card game with him. Try to get nutjob answers.

# Can't, only reasonable ones
Maybe you could get some nutjobs views for better answers.

# Like, who
Well, Bozo is the one you need the drugs for. Show him the three same pictures that the therapist uses:
 - [Picture of Elysium](060-elysium-picture.md)
 - [Picture of an animal](025-tattoo-design.md)
 - [Picture of the hero](070-hero-picture.md)

# I have the pictures
Go show them to Bozo at Casa Bozo. One by one.

# Huh, a nutjob
Now, off to the therapist to play with the cards and tell Bozo's answers.

# All clear!
Well, if you say so. Take both of the drugs from the cabinet.

# Bozo's medicine
Yeah, go feed the antidepressants to him.

# He is not eating them
You should mix antidepressants with the leftover soup. Bozo likes it.

# He ate the soup!
Bozo? Ohh.. Baby Bozo. You can use the Emetic to get them out of Baby Bozo. Show the ready-to-barf Baby Bozo to Bozo. Grab the piggy bank now. Bozo gets you now into the rebel hideout.
