That Baby Bozo is just laying there doing nothing. Maybe some energy for him would be in need. Have you talked to The Mooks?

# I have
They live next to Bozos and first thought you were the Baby Bozo!

# How funny
If you try out the fireworker apparel the Mook lady thinks you *are* Baby Bozo! How about the Ninja outfit? Use the rotary clothes dryer.

# Didn't fool them
Yeah, she wont give you the caffeine lollipop.

# What next?
Well, there are three outfits. Try out the baby outfit.

# Lollipop!
What did the lady say about the lollipop? It gets a child moving.

# So?
Give it to Baby Bozo. The gate is now open.
