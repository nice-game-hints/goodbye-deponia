Goon and June have a nice heater. Maybe they would give it to you if they were somewhere warmer? [Do them a favour, would you.](050-goonandjune.md)

**Middle Rufus**

Goon and June are now living in the distict center. They look so happy. You are such a good friend. Would they let go of their heater now?

# No
They would give it to you if they would get out. Goon wants a chair.

# Chair
There is a deck chair next to Lotti. Go grab it and give it to Goon.

# He's out!
And struggling with the chair. You can now ask the heater from June.
