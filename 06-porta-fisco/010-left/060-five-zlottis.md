**Left Rufus**

Sometimes you need money, of course. The burritos cost 1.25 zlottis each. With 5 zlottis you could get four of them.

# Where are my money?
Technically, the witch in the sewers has *your* money. She stole your acid and sold it for five zlottis to the bar.

# How to get them?
The witch would like to see monkey dance. Different than the current grumpy monkey.

# What to do?
[Did you do a favor for Goon and June?](../010-left/050-goonandjune.md)

# Yes, I did
**Middle Rufus**
Nice, you are such a friend. Did you do more favors for them? They would like to sit outside. Get the deck chair from Lotti and give it to Goon. How nice of you.

# He is ... chairing...
You are a nice person.

# About the money?
**Left Rufus**

Right! As Goon is dealing with the chair upstairs what would happen if you took the van back down?

# I dunno
Let's try. Crank the jack again. The van comes down.

# She is sad
Maybe you could cheer her up somehow. You are their good friend, nevertheless.

# Maybe she would like to dance?
What? As a monkey? Are you serious?

# But...
You mean you would get the fez from the previous monkey (return the crank first) and give it to her and then get some finder's portion of the money she makes?

# But she would get money to buy the crank
From that monkey? Well, do it then. Give her the fez.

# She took it
Convincing, pretty convincing. Now, the paying audience.

# Who?
The witch, of course. Go talk to her and mention that there is a new monkey. Follow her. Collect your (ahem!) commission.
