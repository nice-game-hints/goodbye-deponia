How nice it is to see old friend down here. You should do them a favor.

# What favor
Like, get them away from the sewers. You are such a good friend.

# How?
I'll tell you a secret. The jack, next to the monkey, is the key here. It is missing the obvious, crank handle.

# Who has it?
Isn't is obvious? The organ grinder is cranking it.

# How to get rid of him?
Now, you would like to see the monkey dance. But you don't have five zlottis. [Maybe there is a banana in the banana crate?](055-banana-crate.md)

# Well, there was
Right, this is a game of obvious answers! So, the next obvious thing to do with the banana is?

# To, give it to...
To the monkey, of course.

# Hmm...
Well, that wasn't obvious. But the grinder left! You can now grab... err, borrow... the crank. The original monkey doesn't want to be the monkey anymore. He needs the crank back. Now, onwards with the obviousnesses!

# So, the next obvious thing is?
To insert the crank to the jack, of course. And crank it good. The van with Goon and Jane is in the upper world now, away from the sewers! What a good friend are you.
