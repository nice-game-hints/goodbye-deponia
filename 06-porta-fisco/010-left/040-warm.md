**Left Rufus**

The campsite is too cold for the kids to sleep there. Yup, that is the only bad thing about that place.

# Warmer
[Goon has a nice heater there.](045-heater.md) Give the heater to *Left Rufus*.

# I got the heater
Go warm the campsite. Put the warmer into the ideal camp spot at the campsite.

# Electricity
There are outlets on the left. It is too short for the upper outlet. Anyway, the lever (at the upper platform) will turn the electricity on.

# No electricity
Oh. You need the fuse next to the outlet. And only the top one has it but the cord can't reach it. And the fuse does not move if you try to take it.

# Electical spike?
Good idea! You could shortcut the top outlet to cause the spike.

# With what?
There are those appliances you can stick into electrical outlets. Like forks.

# Fork?
**Middle Rufus** can get the antenna fork from the rebel site. He should give it to *Left Rufus*. Stick the fork into the top outlet.

# The lever!
Oh, someone should keep the lever up when the fork job is done. Who could do that?

# Me?
I know a *safer* way. Give the fork to Rusty! And go hold the lever yourself. Don't worry. It is safe. You have done it thousands of times.

# Ready...
Rusty is holding the fork. Push the lever!

# Zap!
Nice. Now you can grab the fuse and insert it into the bottom socket. Voil√°, warmer campsite.
