**Left Rufus**

Hello darkness, my old friend. Rufus cannot take any items as Goal is crying loudly.

# Annoying!
You should silence her.

# With what?
Hmm.. try first to [get Baby Bozo moving](../020-middle/010-babybozo.md)

# What was that?
Something dropped on you.

# Pacifier
Well, isn't that convinient. Give it to Goal to shut her up.

# Done
You can collect the brush and the branch. Now, the plan to get out of the darkness.

# Is?
Put the brush into the crevice and use the branch to light it up.
