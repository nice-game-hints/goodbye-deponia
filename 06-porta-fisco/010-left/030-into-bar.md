**Left Rufus**

The bouncer won't let you in with the kids. You should get rid of those brats! Did you talk to Rusty?

# I did
He said they could go to sleep if you snuck them tight.

# Where?
Did you explore the sewers? Go to the upper way from the pipe forest.

# Monsters!
No, you are seeing that wrong. It is the ideal campsite for the brat... I mean kids.

# But
Yeah yeah... it's cold and dark.
