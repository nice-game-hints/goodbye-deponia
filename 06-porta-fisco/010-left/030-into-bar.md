**Left Rufus**

The bouncer won't let you in with the kids. You should get rid of those brats! Did you talk to Rusty?

# I did
He said they could go to sleep if you tuck them tight to a warm place.

# Where?
Did you explore the sewers? Go to the upper way from the pipe forest.

# Monsters!
No, you are seeing that wrong. It is the ideal campsite for the brat... I mean kids.

# But
Yeah yeah... it's cold and dark. [Get the campsite warmer.](040-warm.md)

# It is warmer
Speak to the kids at the campsite. They will go camping now.

# They're not sleeping
As Rusty said. You need to tuck them thight. You can use some XXL-sized impromptu blankets.

# What?
[XXL burritos, of course](../020-middle/040-burritos.md) Give the burritos to *Left Rufus*.

# I have the burritos
Go tuck the kids with the burritos.

# They don't sleep!
Kids and their bedtime rituals! They want to hear a story. Hmm... where to *show* them a story?

# The television?
Yes, turn the television on. Adjust the antenna to get better reception.

# Cooking show, but no sleep
It should've put them to sleep. Talk to them again.

# Hungry
Oh my gracesness they're annoying. Where to get food now?

# Where?
[Didn't they talk about dinner at Casa Bozo?](../020-middle/015-cooking.md)

# They did!
**Middle Rufus**
Grandpa Bozo should be cooking at this moment for Bambina and Mama Bozo. Maybe he would have something to feed the kids? Take the pot from Grandpa. Give it to *Left Rufus*.

# Gravy!
Indeed. Tuck them with the gravy. Now, they are safe and nice and you can go to the pub withouth the bouncer giving you a hard time.
