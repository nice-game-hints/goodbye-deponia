**Left Rufus**

The nucleic acid is there for sale. It costs unimaginable amount of money, six zlottis.

# I had five
But not anymore. Could you earn some money?

# As a dancing monkey?
No, silly. That is such a bad deal. Talk to the bartender and tell him about the idea of a tab.

# Tip!
Two zlottis tip is quite good, actually. That would mean only three serves of swill! [Server the swills.](005-server.md)

# Hey!
They threw you out! Get back in and demand what is yours!

# He is not giving it!
Maybe you should just give him the money. [Get Bozo's piggybank.](../020-middle/050-bozo.md)

# I have the piggy bank
Give it to *Left Rufus* and give it to the bartender.
