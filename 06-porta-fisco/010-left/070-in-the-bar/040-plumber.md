**Left Rufus**

Talk to the plumber. Pour him a normal swill by colleting the tankard and filling it from the swill tap.

# No tip
He likes mushroom swill. There is an ad about mushrooms in the wall. Take it.

# Mushroom?
There were mushrooms in the pipe forest. Maybe the witch knows about mushrooms.

# I am there
Give the ad to the witch. You get three guesses.

# None is right
As one of you guesses, talk to the witch.

# Yuck
Mix the mushroom into a tankard full of swill. Serve it to the plumber. Two a-zlottis, ka-ching!
