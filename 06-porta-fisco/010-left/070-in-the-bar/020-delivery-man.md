**Left Rufus**

Talk to the delivery man. Pour him a normal swill by colleting the tankard and filling it from the swill tap.

# No tip
He likes hair growth swill? That is weird. This hair growth issue has been up before...

# Where?
I think it was Bozo's shampoo? And the label on the hair growth swill is interesting too.

# So...
**Middle Rufus**
You should mix Mama Bozo's milk from the counter at Casa Bozo given that [Grandpa Bozo is already cooking.](../../020-middle/015-cooking.md) Give the milk to *Left Rufus*.

# Hair growth milk
Mix it with the swill and serve it to the delivery man. Two zlottis.
