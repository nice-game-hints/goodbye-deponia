**Left Rufus**
Rufus is scared to go the darkness with the eyes and all.

# Light?
Yup, there is a light. But you can only turn it. It is not lit. [Have you checked the Right Rufus?](../030-right/010-surveillance.md)

# Light!
Turn the turnstile to point it to the darkness.

# Uh oh
Umm.. so it turned the lamp post (naturally). That stupid Cowboy Dodo!
