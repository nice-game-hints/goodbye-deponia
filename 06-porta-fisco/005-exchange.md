You should try to meet the other you for this.

# How?
First, Left Rufus and Middle Rufus should get to a meeting point.
 - [Get out of darkness](010-left/010-darkness.md)
 - [Get through the gate](020-middle/01-gate.md)

# These are both done
**Middle Rufus** can now look into the storm drain next to the burrito place.

# What about the sewer Rufus?
Well, you would have to get past the [second darkness](010-left/020-second-darkness.md).

# I did it
Now, go left to the leper colony. The storm drain gate is up left. Use the rung to get up there. The nice mister takes care of the children while you are up there. Go look at the drain gate. Take care the *Middle Rufus* is next to the storm drain in Porta Fisco. You can now drop the items from your inventory between the Left and Middle Rufuses. You don't have to stand next to the grate to do that.
