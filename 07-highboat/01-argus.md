Argus wants a fight.

# How to deal with him?
He just keeps smacking you. Open the hatch with the pedal.

# Right on the kisser!
Cool!

# He closed it...
You have to be quick. While he is holding it, pull the lever to go down.

# Doesn't help
Oh yeah. Open the hatch again with the pedal and remove the throttle valve. The elevator will now have more speed. Pull the lever, again.

# Still nothing
Now, you have to open the hatch, and while Argus holds it open, pull the lever to go down. Then stop it.
