You are on a bridge.

# How to get to the transmitter
You should tilt the bridge.

# How?
Remove one screw and put it in the middle. Remove other screws. Walk to the transmitter and take it.

# I got it!
Now, destroy it! Throw it in the rotor.

# It will ricochet
Could you steady the bridge?

# Steady?
Put a screw into the hole at the left end of the bridge.

# And?
Use the transmitter on the rotor.
