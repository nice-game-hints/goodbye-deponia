The guard won't let you out. Did you talk to him?

# I did
They are looking for rebels. He will inspect your room if you let him.

# There's no one there
Did you check the closet? The other guy is always there.

# No one there
Except the jacket. Maybe it would look like someone.

# It doesn't
Try. Did you check the drawer?

# Drawer?
If you push the upper button next to goal it opens a drawer.

# Shoes!
Yup. Put the shoes into the closet.

# Victim
Call in the guard. He will notice the "dude" in the closet.

# But...
Hmm.. he is not that stupid. What did he say? "How would he get here anyway?"

# How?
There is only one other way in. The air duct.

# Like, John McClane?
Well... uh.. if you say so. Open the air duct.

# With what?
With the letter opener.

# It's open
The guard won't still notice the open air duct. Maybe add some more to it.

# Like what?
Did you try to sleep in the bed already? The bed opens from the bottom button.

# I did!
Well, that is the reason your are trying to get out, I know. Did you yank the mattress away?

# Mattress away!
There you have the slatted frame. It looks a lot like ladder.

# Ladder?
Put it on the air duct opening and invite the guard in again.

# He fell for it
Well, the actual *felling* is just coming in. Hehehee...

# What do you mean?
Open the drawer from the upper button and see yourself.

# Wicked!
Now, close the bed and you can walk out.
