You got out but you are going circles. It is a maze.

# How do I find it?
First, grab a coffee and think through it.

# Yeah yeah
No, relly, take a coffee from the coffee dispenser in the cabin.

# And then?
You noticed the doormat in front of the cabin? It would be shame if something would drop on it.

# Like, coffee?
Yup. Spill some of the coffee on the mat.

# Tidybot!
It is neat! Did you know there was another mat in the core room?

# I did
Sure you did. Anyway, pour some coffee on that mat, too.

# Why?
Hey! I am helping you. The tidybot will come cleaning. It sure knows its way around here.

# It knows
Could it leave you some kind of trail? You can move it by pouring coffee to the mats.

# It moves
It also has a cup holder as you can see.

# Coffee cup
Put a coffee cup on its cup holder. If it would spill some of it.

# It doesn't
Or you can just stick a hole in to the cup with the letter opener when the tidybot is in front of the cabin. Then call it back to the core room. Voil√†, you have the trail to the core room.

# Argh! Stupid tidybot
It did its chore and now it is cleaning the trail. It spent all the coffee in its cup for the one way trip.

# I need a filler
As does the tidybot. Fill it up in front of the cabin and call it back to the core room. Fill it up again in the core room (from the air duct). Now it marks the trail as it is coming back.
